Styled-components(CSS-in-JS): I learned of styled-components about the same time \n                I heard of React.

Typescript supports everything that PropTypes can but does it one better where \n                it allows you to add constraints and only allow specific values. TS supports this across the entire file not being limited to just props but also constants and any data types you define, comes with a linter for types(eslint-plugin, essentially), \n                and allows declaring custom modules using **.d.ts files."},{contentType:"text",content:"The best part is that it compiles into minified and obfuscated JS (minified-> variable names as short as they can be to reduce byte load on the server, obfuscated-> the code will be organized \n                in a manner that it doesn't make much sense) in the same way that React does for production-level code while being type friendly. \n                TS helps in catching more bugs for developers during dev time and adding no extra weight to the end result.
