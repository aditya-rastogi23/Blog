Styled-components(CSS-in-JS): I learned of styled-components about the same time \n                I heard of React.

For example, I was working on a project where I had to dynamically pass a \n                value to multiply margin by(poorly organized list yes). Still, while learning and exploring this, I came across styled-components again and realized that if you're writing CSS in JS files itself, \n                you don't need to worry about sharing variables. This lead me back to styled-components and adding them slowly into code. \n                I realized the props and component structure works great for passing in values and leads to much cleaner and more manageable code \n                than writing CSS and using classNames, especially if we're using frameworks for CSS or even a preprocessor.\n            "},{contentType:"link",content:"https://www.styled-components.com/",title:"Styled Components"},{contentType:"text",content:"6. Typescript: After doing a basic amount of work on this entire React stack, I wanted to explore a bit more. \n                While working on a project, I came across an error where a component was not rendering. I was fetching data from cookies and then passing that as a prop. Everything seemed fine, and then I realized that the prop was misspelled. \n                The prop was a critical one and caused the site to crash, no components being rendered, nothing shown in inspector. \n                I spent a frustratingly long amount of time and started searching for a better way to organize props."},{contentType:"text",content:"Then I came across PropTypes. PropTypes is a pretty popular NPM package that allows you to define the type of props, a default value, \n                which ones are necessary, and which ones are optional. I saw this and saw the syntax being similar to something I had seen before. Next, I came across a video that talked about typescript. Typescript supports everything that PropTypes can but does it one better where \n                it allows you to add constraints and only allow specific values. TS supports this across the entire file not being limited to just props but also constants and any data types you define, comes with a linter for types(eslint-plugin, essentially), \n                and allows declaring custom modules using **.d.ts files."},{contentType:"text",content:"The best part is that it compiles into minified and obfuscated JS (minified-> variable names as short as they can be to reduce byte load on the server, obfuscated-> the code will be organized \n                in a manner that it doesn't make much sense) in the same way that React does for production-level code while being type friendly. \n                TS helps in catching more bugs for developers during dev time and adding no extra weight to the end result.
