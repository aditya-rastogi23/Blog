# Blog micro site

This is the repo for my blog micro site. I'll be using this for both tech and personal blogs.

## Tech used

This blog site has been built using create-react-app and the typescript template it provides.
Along with this, the npm packages used are:

styled-components: CSS-in-js npm package

react-router-dom: for routing the site

styled-theming: switching between dark and light themes (solarized coming later).

gh-pages: hosting the site on github.com

2. run `npm i`
3. run `npm start`
